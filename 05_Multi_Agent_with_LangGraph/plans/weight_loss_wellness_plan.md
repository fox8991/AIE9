## Weight Loss Wellness Plan

## Exercise Plan

### Weekly Schedule (Beginner-Friendly)
- **Monday:** 20-minute walk + 10 minutes stretching
- **Tuesday:** 15 minutes bodyweight strength (squats, push-ups, planks)
- **Wednesday:** Rest or gentle yoga
- **Thursday:** 20-minute walk + 10 minutes stretching
- **Friday:** 15 minutes bodyweight strength
- **Saturday:** 30-minute recreational activity (swimming, cycling, hiking)
- **Sunday:** Rest

### Targets & Progression
- **Cardio:** Work toward **150 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking). Add 5 minutes to walks every 1–2 weeks as tolerated.
- **Strength training:** **2 days/week** (full-body). When 15 minutes feels easy, add a set or increase difficulty (e.g., deeper squats, longer planks).
- **Flexibility/balance:** Stretch after walks/strength sessions; add light balance work (e.g., single-leg stands) 2–3x/week.

### Notes
- Keep intensity at a level where you can talk but not sing during cardio.
- Prioritize consistency over perfection.

## Nutrition Plan

### Core Guidelines
- **Build balanced meals** using mostly whole foods:
  - **Vegetables & fruit:** aim for a variety of colors daily
  - **Lean proteins:** chicken, fish, beans/lentils, tofu, Greek yogurt
  - **Whole grains/starchy carbs:** brown rice, oats, quinoa, whole-grain bread
  - **Healthy fats:** olive oil, avocado, nuts/seeds
- **Portion control:** use smaller plates; aim for half the plate non-starchy vegetables, a palm-sized protein, and a fist-sized whole grain/starchy carb.
- **Hydration:** aim for ~8 cups water/day (more if you’re active/sweating).
- **Limit processed/high-sugar foods and drinks:** reduce soda/juice, pastries, chips, frequent takeout.

### Meal Planning (Simple System)
- Pick **3–4 main meals** you like that can create leftovers.
- Plan **healthy snacks** to prevent impulse eating.
- Make a **shopping list** organized by sections (produce, protein, pantry).
- Prep basics in advance (washed greens, chopped veggies, cooked grains/protein).

### Sample Day of Eating
- **Breakfast:** Overnight oats with berries + nuts
- **Snack:** Apple with almond butter
- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken salad with mixed greens + olive oil dressing
- **Snack:** Greek yogurt (optional small drizzle of honey)
- **Dinner:** Baked salmon + roasted vegetables + quinoa
- **Evening:** Herbal tea

## Tracking & Goals
- Aim for **gradual loss of 1–2 lb/week**.
- Track workouts and a simple food log 3–5 days/week for accountability.
- Reassess every 2–4 weeks and adjust activity or portions if progress stalls.



## Sleep (to support weight loss)

### Why sleep matters
- Sleep helps regulate appetite hormones (ghrelin/leptin), cravings, energy, and recovery.
- Poor sleep is linked with increased hunger and reduced ability to burn fat.

### Sleep targets
- Aim for **7–9 hours/night**.
- Keep a consistent schedule: **same bedtime/wake time** (within ~1 hour) even on weekends.

### Sleep environment (optimize your bedroom)
- **Temperature:** ~**65–68°F (18–20°C)**
- **Darkness:** blackout curtains or a sleep mask
- **Quiet:** earplugs or white noise if needed
- **Comfort:** supportive mattress/pillows

### Sleep hygiene routine
- Build a 20–40 minute wind-down routine (dim lights, reading, light stretching).
- **Limit screens** 60 minutes before bed (or use blue-light reduction + low brightness).
- Avoid heavy meals and alcohol close to bedtime; keep late caffeine in check.

### If you struggle with insomnia
- Consider **CBT-I** (highly effective, structured approach for insomnia).
- Use relaxation techniques: **deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation**.
- Optional gentle supports: **chamomile tea**; discuss supplements (e.g., magnesium) with a clinician if you’re considering them.
