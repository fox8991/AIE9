# Stress & Sleep Wellness Plan (Mental Health)

## Goal
Improve mental health by reducing day-to-day stress and improving sleep quality over the next 4–8 weeks through consistent routines and practical coping skills.

---

## Stress Management Plan
- **Daily movement (stress buffer):** Aim for **~30 minutes of moderate activity most days** (walk, jog, yoga, cycling, dancing—anything you’ll do consistently).
- **Mindfulness / meditation:** Practice **5–10 minutes daily** (breath focus, body scan, or guided meditation). Keep it short and consistent.
- **Social connection:** Schedule regular check-ins with supportive friends/family (even brief calls/texts). Connection reduces isolation and improves resilience.
- **Time management to reduce overwhelm:**
  - Choose **1–3 priorities/day**.
  - Break large tasks into **smaller steps**.
  - Use short work blocks (e.g., 25 minutes) with brief breaks.
- **Healthy boundaries:** Protect time/energy by **saying no**, limiting overcommitment, and setting clear availability windows.
- **Restorative hobbies:** Reserve dedicated time each week for enjoyable activities (reading, art, gardening, music, etc.).
- **Limit stress inputs:** Reduce news/social media exposure—especially later in the day—to prevent cognitive and emotional overload.

## Sleep Quality Plan
- **Consistent schedule:** Keep a steady **bedtime and wake time** (including weekends) to stabilize your body clock.
- **Wind-down routine (30–60 minutes):** Choose 2–3 calming activities such as reading, gentle stretching, warm shower/bath, or light journaling.
- **Screen curfew:** Avoid phones/computers/TV **1–2 hours before bed**; if unavoidable, use night mode and dim brightness.
- **Optimize sleep environment:**
  - **Cool:** ~**65–68°F (18–20°C)**
  - **Dark:** blackout curtains or sleep mask
  - **Quiet:** earplugs or white noise if needed
  - **Comfort:** supportive pillow/mattress and breathable bedding
- **Caffeine/alcohol/meals:**
  - Avoid caffeine **after ~2 PM**
  - Limit alcohol close to bedtime
  - Avoid heavy meals late evening
- **Relaxation tools (as needed):** Progressive muscle relaxation, slow breathing, or calming herbal tea (e.g., chamomile). **If considering supplements (e.g., magnesium), consult a healthcare professional first.**
- **Exercise timing:** Exercise supports sleep, but try to finish vigorous workouts **a few hours before bedtime**.

## Implementation Tips
- **Start small:** Add 1–2 habits first, then build.
- **Track progress:** Note sleep/wake times, stress level (0–10), and what helps/hurts for 2 weeks.
- **Adjust:** Keep what works; change one variable at a time.
- **Get extra support if needed:** If stress feels unmanageable or sleep problems persist, consider talking with a mental health professional or clinician.
