    "\n",
    "Interrelationships between AgentState, SupervisorState and ResearcherState:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They form a hierarchical state for the system, where AgentState is the top-level state that orchestrates the overall system with the context of the full system; SupervisorState is used by the supervisor subgraph, it shares state with the main AgentState for the same key definitions (e.g., `research_brief`); while ResearcherState is fully isolated and each research gets its own instance for independent research.\n",
    "- The state infomration flows down from AgentState to SupervisorState (e.g., converting user request into research brief); and then from SupervisorState to each individual ResearcherState (e.g., convert research brief into individual research topics); then the information flows back from ResearcherState (compressed findings) to SupervisorState for generating a final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not one big state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- This hierarchical state pattern helps with context isolation among the main components of the deep research agent system, and avoids context bloating if we were to stack everything in one big state, especially since each individual research sub-agent could add to lots of state information (e.g., if they all write to the same `messages` list).\n",

       "## Executive Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on extensive research from peer-reviewed studies and sleep medicine organizations, your sleep challenges stem from well-documented issues that significantly impact sleep quality and morning alertness. The scientific evidence shows that irregular bedtimes, electronic device use before sleep, and morning fatigue are interconnected problems that require a systematic, evidence-based approach. This comprehensive plan addresses each issue with specific, actionable strategies backed by sleep research and clinical guidelines.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Science Behind Your Sleep Challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "### Circadian Rhythm Disruption from Irregular Bedtimes\n",
       "\n",
       "Your inconsistent bedtime pattern (10pm-1am range) is causing significant circadian misalignment. A comprehensive systematic review analyzing 59 studies found that irregular sleep timing leads to multiple adverse outcomes including higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, elevated body mass index, insulin resistance, and hypertension [1]. The research revealed that the least regular sleepers had 20-88% higher all-cause mortality risk, independent of sleep duration and quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "The National Sleep Foundation's 2023 consensus statement emphasizes that consistent sleep and wake times are crucial for both mental and physical health. Adults with regular sleep schedules have a 39% lower mortality risk compared to those with irregular schedules and insufficient sleep duration [2]. The mechanisms behind this include circadian misalignment, autonomic imbalance, and systemic inflammation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Electronic Device Impact on Sleep Physiology\n",
       "\n",
       "Your phone use in bed is directly disrupting your sleep through multiple pathways. Blue light exposure from electronic devices (wavelengths 400-500nm) halts melatonin secretion, which is essential for regulating circadian rhythm [3]. The most harmful blue light wavelengths (415-455nm) stimulate the brain, diminish melatonin production, and improve adrenocortical hormone production, creating hormonal imbalance that directly affects sleep quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "A large-scale study of 122,058 participants found that daily screen use prior to bed was associated with a 33% higher prevalence of poor sleep quality and 7.64 fewer minutes of sleep on workdays [4]. The effects were more pronounced for evening chronotypes, with daily screen users going to bed 15.62 minutes later. Research on university students showed that 2 hours of evening light exposure caused an average 1.1-hour circadian phase delay and a 55% decrease in melatonin production [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Immediate Changes You Can Implement Tonight\n",
       "\n",
       "### Digital Sunset Protocol\n",
       "\n",
       "Implement an immediate \"digital sunset\" 90 minutes before your target bedtime. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends eliminating screen use at least 60-90 minutes before bedtime [6]. This allows your natural melatonin production to begin, as blue light exposure suppresses melatonin by over 50% within two hours according to NIH research.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Specific actions:**\n",
       "- Set a daily phone alarm for 90 minutes before bedtime\n",
       "- Use your phone's \"Do Not Disturb\" or \"Sleep Mode\" features\n",
       "- Charge your phone outside the bedroom\n",
       "- Replace evening screen time with reading a physical book, gentle stretching, or meditation\n",
       "\n",
       "### Emergency Sleep Schedule Stabilization\n",
       "\n",
       "Choose a consistent bedtime between 10-11pm and wake time that allows for 7-9 hours of sleep (the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendation for adults). Start with your most natural preference within this range, then stick to it every single night, including weekends. Research shows that even small deviations can disrupt circadian rhythm recovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Implementation strategy:**\n",
       "- Calculate backwards from your required wake time to determine bedtime\n",
       "- Set multiple alarms: 2 hours before bed (wind-down), 90 minutes before (digital sunset), 30 minutes before (final preparations)\n",
       "- Use blackout curtains or eye masks to ensure darkness\n",
       "- Set room temperature between 65-68°F (18-20°C) for optimal sleep\n",

       "\n",
       "Create a sleep sanctuary that supports natural sleep architecture. Research shows that sleep consists of Non-REM stages (light to deep restorative sleep) and REM sleep (90-minute cycles for emotional processing and memory consolidation) [7]. Your environment should facilitate these natural cycles.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Environmental modifications:**\n",
       "- Remove all electronic devices from the bedroom\n",
       "- Use blackout curtains or heavy drapes to block external light\n",
       "- Install a white noise machine or use earplugs to minimize sound disruption\n",
       "- Ensure your mattress and pillows provide proper spinal alignment\n",
       "- Keep the room cool (65-68°F) as body temperature naturally drops during sleep\n",
       "\n",
       "### Pre-Sleep Routine Protocol\n",
       "\n",
       "Develop a 60-90 minute wind-down routine that signals your body to prepare for sleep. Research on children showed that consistent bedtime routines led to sleeping an average of more than one hour longer per night, with a dose-dependent relationship between routine frequency and sleep quality [8].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Evidence-based routine components:**\n",
       "- Light stretching or gentle yoga (promotes muscle relaxation)\n",
       "- Reading fiction (engages imagination without stimulating problem-solving)\n",
       "- Progressive muscle relaxation (systematically tense and release muscle groups)\n",
       "- Warm bath or shower (the subsequent cooling mimics natural body temperature drop)\n",
       "- Meditation or deep breathing exercises (activates parasympathetic nervous system)\n",
       "- Write in a gratitude journal (reduces anxiety and racing thoughts)\n",
       "\n",
       "## Advanced Strategies for Sleep Onset and Quality\n",
       "\n",
       "### Light Exposure Management\n",
       "\n",
       "Properly manage light exposure throughout the day to strengthen your circadian rhythm. Get bright light exposure (preferably sunlight) within the first hour of waking for 15-30 minutes. This helps establish your circadian anchor point and improves evening melatonin production.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Light management protocol:**\n",
       "- Morning: Seek bright light exposure immediately upon waking\n",
       "- Afternoon: Maintain normal indoor lighting, take breaks outdoors when possible\n",
       "- Evening: Dim lights 2-3 hours before bedtime, use warm-toned bulbs (below 3000K)\n",
       "- Night: Use minimal red-toned lighting if you must navigate in darkness\n",
       "\n",
       "### Cognitive and Physical Preparation\n",
       "\n",
       "Address the mental and physical factors that may be contributing to your morning fatigue. Poor sleep quality often results from insufficient deep sleep phases or frequent micro-awakenings that fragment sleep architecture.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Optimization strategies:**\n",
       "- Avoid caffeine after 2pm (caffeine has a 6-8 hour half-life)\n",
       "- Stop eating large meals 3 hours before bedtime\n",
       "- Limit alcohol consumption, especially within 4 hours of sleep\n",
       "- Practice \"brain dumping\" - write down tomorrow's tasks or concerns 2 hours before bed\n",
       "- Use relaxation techniques like 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8)\n",
       "\n",
       "## Long-Term Habit Development Plan\n",
       "\n",
       "### Week 1-2: Foundation Building\n",
       "\n",
       "Focus exclusively on establishing consistent sleep and wake times. Research shows this is the single most important factor for sleep quality improvement. Track your progress using a sleep diary or wearable device to monitor sleep regularity index.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Week 3-4: Digital Hygiene Mastery\n",
       "\n",
       "Expand your digital sunset protocol and create lasting boundaries with technology. Studies show that using screens in bed increases insomnia risk by 59% and cuts sleep time by 24 minutes [9]. Develop alternative evening activities that promote relaxation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Week 5-8: Advanced Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "Fine-tune your sleep environment, nutrition timing, and stress management practices. Begin incorporating regular exercise (but not within 4 hours of bedtime) as physical activity improves sleep quality and reduces sleep onset time.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Week 9-12: Sustainability and Troubleshooting\n",
       "\n",
       "Develop strategies for maintaining your improved sleep habits during travel, stress, or schedule disruptions. Create backup plans for when your primary routine is compromised.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Addressing Morning Fatigue Specifically\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sleep Architecture Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "Morning fatigue despite adequate sleep duration often indicates poor sleep quality or inappropriate wake timing within your sleep cycle. Focus on waking during lighter sleep phases rather than deep sleep or REM phases.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Strategies for refreshing mornings:**\n",
       "- Use a smart alarm that wakes you during light sleep phases\n",
       "- Maintain consistent wake times even if you go to bed late occasionally\n",
       "- Get immediate bright light exposure upon waking\n",
       "- Engage in light physical activity within 30 minutes of waking\n",
       "- Avoid hitting snooze, which fragments sleep and increases grogginess\n",
       "\n",
       "### Addressing Underlying Issues\n",
       "\n",
       "If morning fatigue persists after 4-6 weeks of consistent sleep hygiene, consider evaluation for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or circadian rhythm disorders. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends professional evaluation for persistent sleep issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Monitoring and Adjustment Protocol\n",
       "\n",
       "### Tracking Metrics\n",
       "\n",
       "Monitor these key indicators of sleep improvement:\n",
       "- Sleep onset time (should decrease to under 20 minutes)\n",
       "- Number of nighttime awakenings (should minimize)\n",
       "- Morning energy levels (1-10 scale daily rating)\n",
       "- Daytime alertness and cognitive performance\n",
       "- Mood and emotional regulation\n",
       "\n",
       "### Progressive Refinement\n",
       "\n",
       "Adjust your plan based on objective feedback. If certain strategies aren't working after 2 weeks of consistent implementation, modify rather than abandon them. Sleep improvement is highly individual, and fine-tuning is essential for long-term success.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Expected Timeline and Outcomes\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on sleep research, you can expect:\n",
       "- **Week 1-2:** Improved sleep onset time and reduced nighttime phone use\n",
       "- **Week 3-4:** More consistent energy levels and easier morning awakening\n",
       "- **Week 5-8:** Significant improvements in deep sleep quality and daytime alertness\n",
       "- **Week 9-12:** Fully established habits with sustained improvements in overall sleep quality\n",
       "\n",
       "The scientific evidence strongly supports that addressing sleep regularity, eliminating pre-sleep screen exposure, and implementing comprehensive sleep hygiene will significantly improve your sleep quality and morning energy levels. Consistency and patience are key, as circadian rhythm adjustments typically require 2-4 weeks to stabilize.\n",

    "\n",
    "Parallel researchers are in general faster since the research process since the research process can be done concurrently by multiple researchers; by contrast sequential research will be slower since research for one section is built on top of earlier sections. In addition the parallel researchers structure used in this implementation can decompose the user question into structured research topics more organically instead of following predefined sections or formats.\n",

       "# Comprehensive Evidence-Based Solutions for Lower Back Pain and Neck Stiffness in Sedentary Software Engineers\n",
       "\n",
       "## Executive Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "Lower back pain and neck stiffness from prolonged sitting affect a substantial portion of office workers, with back pain being the leading cause of job-related disability in the United States. This comprehensive analysis examines three evidence-based approaches—ergonomic solutions, strength training, and stretching/aerobic exercise—to address these issues for a 30-year-old software engineer working 8+ hours daily. The research reveals that **no single approach is superior**; rather, a multimodal strategy combining all three interventions provides optimal results. The evidence shows that ergonomic interventions reduce pain by approximately 28% (Visual Analog Scale), strength training can decrease neck pain by 35-45%, and targeted exercise programs significantly improve both pain and functional outcomes within 4-12 weeks.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Approach 1: Ergonomic Solutions\n",
       "\n",
       "### Strength of Scientific Evidence\n",
       "\n",
       "The evidence supporting ergonomic interventions for musculoskeletal pain is substantial but shows mixed results depending on the specific intervention and measurement outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine evaluated 24 randomized controlled trials with 4,086 participants across diverse workplace environments. The study found **significant reductions in pain intensity** with a mean difference in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores of -0.28 (95% CI: -0.43, -0.14, p = 0.0001). Most importantly for your situation, ergonomic interventions significantly reduced musculoskeletal disorders-related pain in the lower back with an odds ratio of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40–0.70, p < 0.00001), representing approximately a **47% reduction in lower back pain odds** [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "However, a critical finding emerged from another systematic review: when comparing interventions for office workers already experiencing symptoms, **exercise showed stronger evidence than ergonomic interventions alone**. A review of 27 randomized controlled trials found moderate-quality evidence that neck/shoulder strengthening exercises were effective for symptomatic office workers, while ergonomic interventions showed only low-quality evidence of effectiveness [2]. This suggests that for someone like you who already has developed pain, ergonomics should be viewed as a foundational element rather than a standalone solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "The effectiveness varies by intervention type. While physical activity combined with ergonomics may lessen back pain intensity, one network meta-analysis found these effects were often minor and statistically insignificant for preventing back pain, suggesting **limited effectiveness for prevention alone** but greater value for symptom management [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Timeline for Results\n",
       "\n",
       "Ergonomic improvements offer both immediate and progressive benefits:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Immediate Relief (Same Day to 1 Week):**\n",
       "- Proper monitor positioning can provide immediate reduction in neck strain\n",
       "- Correct chair adjustments offer instant lumbar support improvements\n",
       "- Keyboard and mouse repositioning reduces wrist and elbow strain within hours\n",
       "\n",
       "**Short-Term Improvements (2-6 Weeks):**\n",
       "A 2025 study examining office chair designs found that heavy-duty ergonomic chairs with swivel mechanisms led to **longer comfort times before discomfort set in**, particularly in legs and neck, with users reporting delayed body response to discomfort [4]. The transition period typically requires 2-4 weeks for adaptation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Long-Term Benefits (3-6 Months):**\n",
       "Research on sit-stand desks showed **significant reductions in musculoskeletal discomfort and post-work fatigue over six months**, along with improvements in overall well-being [5]. Another six-month intervention with sit-stand workstations resulted in notable benefits including a reduction in waist circumference (-1.81 cm, p = 0.04) and improvements in body composition, fatigue, and quality of life [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Time Commitment Required\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the most attractive aspects of ergonomic solutions is the minimal ongoing time commitment:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Initial Setup: 2-4 Hours (One-Time)**\n",
       "- Chair adjustment and setup: 30-45 minutes\n",
       "- Monitor positioning and desk organization: 30-60 minutes\n",
       "- Keyboard and mouse positioning: 15-30 minutes\n",
       "- Sit-stand desk protocol establishment: 30-60 minutes\n",
       "- Professional ergonomic assessment (recommended): 60-90 minutes\n",
       "\n",
       "**Daily Ongoing Time: Minimal Active Effort**\n",
       "- Sit-stand transitions: 2-5 minutes spread throughout the day\n",
       "- Posture checks and micro-adjustments: 30 seconds every hour\n",
       "- No dedicated exercise time required for basic ergonomics\n",
       "\n",
       "**Weekly Maintenance: 5-10 Minutes**\n",
       "- Reviewing and adjusting workstation setup as needed\n",
       "- Checking that ergonomic equipment remains properly positioned\n",
       "\n",
       "### Specific Implementation Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Office Chair Selection and Setup\n",
       "\n",
       "Research consistently shows that chairs meeting ergonomic requirements reduce the severity, intensity, and frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms. Essential ergonomic features include [7]:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Critical Chair Features:**\n",
       "- **Dynamic lumbar support**: Adjustable lower back support that follows your spine's natural curve\n",
       "- **Adjustable seat depth and height**: Seat height allowing feet flat on floor with thighs parallel to ground; seat depth leaving 2-4 inches between seat edge and back of knees\n",
       "- **High backrest with recline function**: Backrest reaching at least to shoulder blades, with 110-130 degree recline capability\n",
       "- **Multi-directional armrests**: Adjustable in height, width, and angle to support forearms without shoulder elevation\n",
       "- **Pressure-relieving seat design**: Waterfall edge and adequate cushioning to prevent pressure on thighs\n",
       "- **Breathable materials**: Mesh or fabric that prevents heat buildup during long sitting periods\n",
       "\n",
       "A 2025 study analyzing 426 office workers found that **heavy-duty chairs with swivel mechanisms (group 1) and lighter ergonomic chairs (group 2) led to significantly longer comfort times before discomfort**, while regular wooden and plastic chairs resulted in significant discomfort across all body parts [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Monitor Positioning Guidelines\n",
       "\n",
       "Improper monitor placement forces operators into awkward positions, directly contributing to neck pain and stiffness. Evidence-based positioning includes [8, 9]:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Optimal Monitor Setup:**\n",
       "- **Height**: Top of screen at or below eye level, with the monitor positioned **15-20 degrees below horizontal eye level** for optimal viewing\n",
       "- **Distance**: 20-40 inches (arm's length) from your eyes to the screen\n",
       "- **Placement**: Directly in front of you to avoid neck rotation\n",
       "- **Angle**: Slight backward tilt (10-20 degrees) to reduce glare and maintain neutral neck posture\n",
       "\n",
       "For multiple monitors, position the primary monitor directly in front and the secondary at an angle to minimize neck strain [8]. The Ergonomics Guidelines for Computer Workstations emphasize setting the screen at or below eye level and maintaining approximately 18 inches distance from the eyes [10]. CDC guidance specifically recommends having the top of the screen at or below eye level, positioned **20 degrees below eye level** [11].\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Keyboard and Mouse Positioning\n",
       "\n",
       "Research demonstrates that keyboard distance significantly impacts wrist and elbow joint posture. A study using motion capture technology found that **when the keyboard was 8 cm away from the desk edge, wrist flexion decreased 83% and radial deviation decreased 89%**, with wrist flexion decreasing by up to 94% with optimal positioning [12].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Evidence-Based Positioning:**\n",
       "- **Keyboard height**: Maximum 2.5 inches above the workstation surface\n",
       "- **Keyboard distance**: 8-15 cm from the desk edge to maintain neutral wrist position\n",
       "- **Elbow angle**: Maintain 90-degree angle or slightly greater (90-110 degrees)\n",
       "- **Mouse placement**: Same height and close to keyboard to minimize reaching\n",
       "- **Wrist position**: Neutral (straight), avoiding flexion, extension, or radial/ulnar deviation\n",
       "\n",
       "CDC research identified that **keyboard height above elbow height was the primary factor for neck and shoulder symptoms**, while radial deviation was the only postural factor for hand and arm disorders [13]. Using **compact keyboards** allows less stretching between keyboard and mouse, and **vertical mice** encourage a neutral hand position, reducing strain [14].\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Sit-Stand Desk Protocols\n",
       "\n",
       "Your previous experience with standing desk leg fatigue is common and can be addressed through proper protocols. The key is **gradual progression and alternating positions** rather than prolonged standing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Evidence-Based Sit-Stand Schedule:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Research examining four different sit-stand schedules (90-min sitting/30-min standing, 80/40, 105/15, and 60/60) found that **office workers prefer sit/stand duration ratios between 1:1 and 3:1**, with longer standing periods showing a tendency to reduce muscle fatigue [15, 16]. However, the study noted that more active break-time activities seemed more effective than simply standing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommended Progressive Protocol:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*Week 1-2 (Adaptation Phase):*\n",
       "- 45 minutes sitting / 15 minutes standing\n",
       "- Repeat 4-5 times during workday\n",
       "- Total standing: 60-75 minutes daily\n",
       "\n",
       "*Week 3-4 (Building Tolerance):*\n",
       "- 40 minutes sitting / 20 minutes standing\n",
       "- Repeat 4-5 times during workday\n",
       "- Total standing: 80-100 minutes daily\n",
       "\n",
       "*Week 5+ (Maintenance):*\n",
       "- 30-35 minutes sitting / 25-30 minutes standing\n",
       "- Repeat 4-5 times during workday\n",
       "- Total standing: 100-150 minutes daily\n",
       "- Target: 2-4 hours standing time in 8-hour workday\n",
       "\n",
       "**To Prevent Leg Fatigue:**\n",
       "- Use an **anti-fatigue mat** (essential for reducing leg discomfort)\n",
       "- **Shift weight** between feet every 10-15 minutes while standing\n",
       "- Perform **calf raises and ankle circles** during standing periods\n",
       "- Wear **supportive footwear** (avoid hard-soled dress shoes during standing)\n",
       "- **Gradually increase** standing time over 4-6 weeks\n",
       "- Include **walking breaks** rather than just standing (see sit-stand-walk intervention below)\n",
       "\n",
       "A study on sit-stand-walk interventions found that a **sit-stand-walk group reported significantly lower levels of musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived physical fatigue** compared to those in stationary sitting or standing positions [17]. This suggests incorporating brief walks (even just around your desk area) during transition periods.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Lighting and Additional Ergonomic Factors\n",
       "\n",
       "Proper lighting reduces eye strain and associated tension in neck and shoulder muscles. Key recommendations include [10]:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Position monitor perpendicular to windows to minimize glare\n",
       "- Use indirect or adjustable task lighting rather than harsh overhead lights\n",
       "- Adjust screen brightness to match ambient lighting\n",
       "- Use blue-light filtering if working during evening hours\n",
       "- Take visual breaks using the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds)\n",

       "#### Evidence for Lower Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "A systematic review and meta-analysis of 60 studies examining resistance exercise training in sedentary office workers found **modest reductions in neck discomfort (SMD = -1.76) and shoulder discomfort (SMD = -13.29)**, along with improvements in shoulder muscle strength (SMD = 4.13) and neck extensor strength (SMD = 9.07). However, the review noted high uncertainty due to heterogeneity and bias [18].\n",
       "\n",
       "More compelling evidence comes from targeted interventions. A randomized controlled trial investigating **core stabilization exercises versus conventional physiotherapy for chronic non-specific low back pain** in 36 participants showed that the core exercise group demonstrated:\n",

       "\n",
       "### Strength of Scientific Evidence\n",
       "\n",
       "The evidence for stretching and aerobic exercise shows more nuanced results, with effectiveness varying significantly by intervention type, duration, and whether used for prevention versus treatment.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Evidence for Stretching\n",
       "\n",
       "A systematic review investigating the impact of physical exercise on low back pain in office workers analyzed 11 articles with diverse exercise protocols lasting from 6 weeks to 12 months. Results indicated that **exercise markedly improves lower back pain symptoms, flexibility, and quality of life**, especially with supervised or video-supported interventions. The review found that **low back pain affects approximately 34% of office workers** and that **physical exercise is strongly recommended for lower back pain management**. Recommended interventions included **short-duration exercises (10-15 minutes) performed 3-5 days a week during work hours** [34].\n",
       "\n",
       "However, for neck pain specifically, the evidence for stretching is less robust. A systematic review and meta-analysis examining exercise effectiveness for office workers with non-specific neck pain found that **strengthening exercises had clinically significant effects on pain reduction, whereas endurance and stretching exercises showed limited effects** on both pain and quality of life [23]. Another systematic review of nine randomized controlled trials found **strong evidence for muscle strengthening and endurance exercises in treating neck pain**, but noted that **no exercise type was identified as being effective in the prevention** of nonspecific neck pain [35].\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Evidence for Aerobic Exercise\n",
       "\n",
       "The evidence for aerobic exercise in managing chronic low back pain is substantial. A Cochrane Review protocol emphasizes that **clinical guidelines recommend exercise as the first line of care for chronic low back pain**, with aerobic activities being among the diverse modalities studied [36].\n",
       "\n",
       "A systematic review protocol investigating aerobic exercise effects on chronic non-specific low back pain noted that **aerobic exercises are among the best treatment options for chronic low back pain, reducing pain and disability in patients**. The review highlighted that chronic low back pain affects approximately 39% of the population during their lifetime and **costs the U.S. healthcare system over 100 billion dollars annually** [37].\n",
       "\n",
       "A study comparing stabilization and muscle strengthening exercise programs in 70 sedentary women with chronic low back pain found that **both types of exercises significantly reduced pain and functional disability** over a 20-week program. Notably, **stabilization exercises showed greater effectiveness with longer-lasting results** (effects lasting 12 weeks compared to 4 weeks for muscle strengthening), and **both programs positively affected muscle strength for 8 weeks post-completion** [28].\n",
       "\n",
       "The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) emphasizes that **exercise therapy is a key component of effective chronic low back pain management**, with evidence-based treatment recommendations advocating non-pharmacological approaches to improve physical function and overall quality of life. Importantly, **all chronic low back pain guidelines acknowledge that no one particular exercise modality is superior to others**, suggesting an **individualized approach may be preferable** [33].\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Evidence Quality Concerns\n",
       "\n",
       "A systematic review examining clinical practice guidelines for exercise therapy and physical activity in low back pain found that **only 27% of guidelines provided satisfactory quality evidence, while 72% were rated as critical**. Significantly, **none of the guidelines discussed physical activity recommendations for primary prevention of low back pain**, though **100% of guidelines recommended at least one type of supervised exercise in management** and **88% provided recommendations for people to stay active** [38].\n",
       "\n",
       "A systematic review with meta-analysis on workplace physical exercise as treatment for low back pain yielded concerning findings: after analyzing 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria, the meta-analysis showed that **workplace physical exercise did not significantly reduce the incidence of low back pain** (difference of means=0.62, 95%CI -0.8-2.04, p<0.4) [39]. This suggests that while exercise is beneficial for management, its preventive effects in workplace settings require more robust research.\n",

       "Despite mixed findings for prevention, a meta-analysis by Steffens et al. found that **exercise prevented lower back pain by 35-45% and sick leave due to lower back pain by 25-75%** [22], indicating that properly designed exercise programs can have preventive benefits.\n",

    "- Switched summarization model to gpt-4o-mini and reduced max content length to 20000 tokens. Reason is that initially I used all Anthropic models, but was getting rate limiting 429 errors. Also tested haiku model but still gets the 429 errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switched other nodes including research, compress and final report model to Sonnet 4.5 for better performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_concurrent_research_units` increased from 1 to 3 so we can have parallelization of the researcher nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Updated `max_researcher_iterations` to 4 for more iterations of supervisor (e.g., max number of think_tool and parallel ConductResearch calls is increased to 4). Default value of 2 actually caused the supervisor to skip researching certain topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "`max_react_tool_calls` is increased to 3 for more tool calling for each researcher. These two changes will improve the research quality from both individual researchers as well as the main supervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced `max_content_length` from 50K to 25K. This is because when using the original value, the summarization call often times out after 60 seconds, which indicates the web page content may be too large to finish the summarization within 60 seconds. The 60 seconds timeout is defined in the following code for search result summary:\n",

    "```\n",
    "        # Execute summarization with timeout to prevent hanging\n",
    "        summary = await asyncio.wait_for(\n",

    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Overall these parameters are chosen such that we can have a high quality research report meanwhile also balancing not to get rate limited by LLM providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the `run_custom_research` call, added `subgraphs=True` option so that we can also stream events from inside the `research_supervisor` subgraph. Otherwise the logs from `supervisor` and `supervisor_tools` will not be streamed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of the output\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of the report is very decent, as it covers very comprehensive research insights for all the 3 approaches user has requested to investigate. Each approach have evidence based details, actionable insights and recommendations with rich citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is a result from a few back-and-forth tests, where the deep research agent either only generates shallow research result (e.g., this mostly happened when using a small value for `max_researcher_iterations`, which limits the amount of thinking and research the supervisor can do); or doing too much parallelization or generating too much token that we can rate limited by Anthropic with 429 error, and/or 60 sec timeout error from summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we settled with the configuration that balanced research quality with constratints from service providers, which led to the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What worked well and what could be improved\n",
    "\n",
    "What worked well:\n",
    "- Deep research agent is working as expected as we can see the research brief gets created, and supervisor is able to call 3 parallel ConductResearch calls, use think_tool to plan and summarize the results, and each research is able to call multiple tools to find rich sources of information for these topics.\n",
    "- Using openai:gpt-4o-mini for summarization offloaded the most frequent API calls to a different provider, avoiding rate limit by Anthropic. I was originally using Anthropic that kept getting 429 errors. \n",
    "- The final report is very comprehensive and useful with decent amount of citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could be improved:\n",
    "- Our deep research agent is often limited by service providers, such as 429 error from Anthropic due to rate limiting. This caused us to sacrifice or limiting the configuration for some aspects of the system, such as the `max_researcher_iterations` and output token at various nodes. \n",
    "- For example the final report is truncated before showing the full citation list since we have to set `final_report_model_max_tokens` to a reasonable value without getting rate limited. \n",
    "- For a given budget, we'll have to tweak these configuration values to balance cost and research quality. Or we might need to add code to wait/retry after getting rate limited. Otherwise we'll need to increase our budget to have a rate limit."
