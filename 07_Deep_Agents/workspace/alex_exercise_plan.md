## Important Notes

- **Stay hydrated** throughout your workout
- **Consistency matters more than intensity** - aim for all 6 sessions
- **Morning workouts** help boost energy for the entire day
- **Deep breathing** during cool-downs helps manage anxiety
- **Progress gradually** - Week 2 increases sets and reps moderately

## Safety Reminders
- Warm up properly to prevent injury
- Use proper form over speed or heavy weights
- Stop if you experience pain (not to be confused with normal muscle fatigue)
- Modify exercises as needed based on your fitness level
