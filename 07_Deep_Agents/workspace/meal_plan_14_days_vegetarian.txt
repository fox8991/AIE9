## 2-Week Vegetarian Meal Plan and Nutrition Guidance for Alex

### General Nutrition Tips for Sustained Energy and Better Sleep:
- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to maintain energy levels. Dehydration can lead to fatigue.
- **Balanced Meals**: Include a mix of complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats in every meal.
- **Eat Regularly**: Aim for every 3-4 hours to keep energy levels stable.
- **Limit Caffeine**: Especially in the afternoon and evening, as it can disturb sleep.
- **Include Relaxing Foods**: Foods high in magnesium (like leafy greens and nuts) and tryptophan (found in beans and seeds) may help improve sleep quality.
