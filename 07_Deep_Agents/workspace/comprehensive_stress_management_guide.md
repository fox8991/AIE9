   - Neck and jaw
   - Face and forehead

### Implementation Tips

- **Friday:** 15 minutes bodyweight exercises
- **Saturday:** 30-minute recreational activity (swimming, cycling, hiking)
- **Sunday:** Rest

### Stress-Specific Exercise Recommendations
**For immediate stress relief:**
- Take a short walk, preferably in nature
- 10 jumping jacks or quick movement
- Gentle stretching, especially neck and shoulders
- Yoga or tai chi

**For chronic stress management:**
- Build a consistent exercise routine
- Choose activities you enjoy (increases adherence)

## Strategy 5: Grounding Techniques

### Overview
Grounding techniques help you stay present and connected to the current moment, especially during times of acute stress, anxiety, or feeling overwhelmed. These techniques work by engaging your senses and shifting focus away from stressful thoughts.

1. **5 things you can SEE:** Look around and identify five objects. Notice their colors, shapes, and details.
2. **4 things you can HEAR:** Listen carefully. Identify four distinct sounds (traffic, birds, air conditioning, your breath).
3. **3 things you can FEEL:** Notice three physical sensations (feet on floor, clothes on skin, chair supporting you).
4. **2 things you can SMELL:** Identify two scents. If you can't smell anything, name two favorite scents.
5. **1 thing you can TASTE:** Notice any taste in your mouth, or name your favorite taste.

### 8. Time Management and Boundaries
Poor time management and lack of boundaries contribute significantly to chronic stress.

- Take regular breaks throughout the day
- Delegate when possible
- Schedule personal time like you would meetings
