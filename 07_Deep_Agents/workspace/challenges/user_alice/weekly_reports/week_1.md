## 🎯 Areas Needing Attention

### Sleep Quality (Avg 5.4/10) ⚠️
Sleep has been consistently in the 5-6 range, with Day 7 remaining at 5/10. Your feedback confirms: "sleep is still rough."

**This is important** because:
- Better sleep = improved mood and energy
- Sleep is one of your primary goals (reduce stress and improve sleep)
- Insomnia is a known condition we're working with

### Energy Levels (Avg 5.6/10)
Energy dipped to 4/10 on Day 4, and has been fluctuating. This could be related to sleep quality.

## 💡 Recommendations for Week 2

### Sleep Focus:
1. **Evening Wind-Down Routine:** Create a 30-minute pre-bed routine (no screens, dim lights, relaxation)
2. **Timing Consistency:** Try going to bed and waking up at the same time every day
3. **Enhanced Mindfulness:** Since you progressed to 10-minute meditation, consider adding a second session specifically for sleep (bedtime body scan or sleep meditation)
4. **Sleep Environment:** Review your bedroom setup (temperature, darkness, noise)

### Maintain Momentum:
- Keep up the daily yoga - you're building a great habit!
- Continue with your meal plan adherence
- You're progressing well with mindfulness practice

### Energy Support:
- Consider the connection between sleep and energy
- Stay hydrated throughout the day
- Get some natural light exposure in the morning (helps regulate sleep-wake cycle)

## 🔄 Adaptation Opportunity

Since sleep quality is averaging below 6/10 and remains a concern, I can help adjust your plan to focus more specifically on sleep improvement. This might include:
- Adding sleep-specific mindfulness techniques
- Adjusting exercise timing or intensity
- Incorporating sleep-supportive nutrition strategies
- Creating a structured bedtime routine

**Would you like me to adapt your plan to put more emphasis on improving sleep?**

## Looking Ahead to Week 2

You've built an amazing foundation! Week 1 was about establishing the habit, and you nailed it. Now in Week 2, let's refine and optimize - especially around sleep.

Keep showing up, Alice. You're doing great! 💪✨
