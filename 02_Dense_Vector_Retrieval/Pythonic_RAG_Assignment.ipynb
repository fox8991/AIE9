    "Async allows the vector database creation task to be executed concurrently across batches, which reduces user-perceived latency.  Specifically, since `abuild_from_list` calls into `async_get_embeddings`, which calls OpenAI's embedding API (I/O-bound), `async` enables the code to run the batch requests in parellel, instead of running each batch request in sequence. For example, with 5 batches, we can save roughly 4 batches worth of latency using `async` vs `sync` (in reality the actual latency improvements by async could be affected by rate limiting, network speed, etc.)."

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicity's sake."

    "- `seed` parameter: We can set the same [seed](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/advanced-usage) parameter across API calls and ensure all other parameters like the `prompt` and `temperature` to be the same across requests. This is OpenAI specific. As of Jan 2026, the OpenAI API doc has marked the `seed` parameter as [deprecated](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat_create-seed) though. \n",

      "Hello! The \"best\" way to write a loop in Java depends on what you're trying to achieve, but I’m happy to share some general advice to help you write clear and efficient loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common loop types in Java:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For loop**  \n",
      "Great when you know exactly how many times you need to iterate.\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
      "    System.out.println(\"Iteration \" + i);\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **While loop**  \n",
      "Best when you want to continue looping until a condition changes, and you don’t necessarily know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "int i = 0;\n",
      "while (i < 10) {\n",
      "    System.out.println(\"Iteration \" + i);\n",
      "    i++;\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Do-while loop**  \n",
      "Similar to while, but guarantees the loop runs at least once.\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "int i = 0;\n",
      "do {\n",
      "    System.out.println(\"Iteration \" + i);\n",
      "    i++;\n",
      "} while (i < 10);\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhanced for loop (for-each)**  \n",
      "Perfect for iterating over arrays or collections without worrying about indexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "String[] fruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"};\n",
      "for (String fruit : fruits) {\n",
      "    System.out.println(fruit);\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips for writing the best loop:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Use descriptive variable names:** Instead of `i`, if your loop relates to items or users, name it accordingly (`userIndex`, `itemCount`).\n",
      "- **Avoid infinite loops:** Make sure your loop condition will eventually become false.\n",
      "- **Choose the loop best matched to the task:** For example, use enhanced for-loops for collections to keep your code clean and concise.\n",
      "- **Keep the loop body focused:** Avoid heavy calculations or complex logic inside loops if possible to improve readability.\n",
      "- **Consider readability:** Sometimes, breaking complex loops into smaller methods helps.\n",
      "\n",

This is much more helpful than giving a generic source citing like \"Source 1\", \"Source 2\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In a production system with a lot more data sources, we can add more metadata such as categories (e.g., physical health, mental health, etc) to each data chunk. The metadata can be either added manually, or use a classification model. During the retrival phase, we can infer from user query which metadata tag to filter the chunks to retrieve from, and then perform the actual retrival so that the results could be more relevant to user query, also the retrival step can finish faster due to metadata/category filtering.

      "Response: To reduce anxiety, several techniques and lifestyle approaches proven to ease stress and calm the mind are recommended:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mindfulness and Meditation:  \n",
      "   - Practicing mindfulness helps anchor you in the present moment, reducing worrying about the past or future which often drives anxiety. Mindfulness can be as simple as appreciating nature during a walk or using apps like Calm or Headspace.  \n",
      "   - Meditation focuses on bodily sensations such as breathing or repeating a phrase, helping knit together body and mind. A specific meditation technique mentioned is box breathing (inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal counts) which is helpful for calming anxiety.  \n",
      "(According to https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/5-timeless-habits-for-better-health-202509243106)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Deep Breathing and Relaxation Techniques:  \n",
      "   - Deep breathing exercises, such as inhaling for 4 counts, holding for 4, and exhaling for 4, provide immediate relief from anxiety.  \n",
      "   - Progressive muscle relaxation, which involves tensing and releasing different muscle groups systematically, is also effective.  \n",
      "   - Other methods include grounding techniques (naming sensory experiences) and listening to calming music or taking nature walks.  \n",
      "(From data/HealthWellnessGuide.txt)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Managing Stress with Positive Mindset Practices:  \n",
      "   - Identifying stress triggers, recognizing that feelings are fleeting, and cultivating positive self-affirmations can improve mood and attitude, thus reducing anxiety.  \n",
      "   - Taking a step back during stressful moments and practicing relaxation regularly, even outside of stressful situations, helps build resilience.  \n",
      "(From data/A-STEP-BY-STEP-GUIDE-TO-WELLNESS.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Long-term Lifestyle Approaches include Regular Exercise, Adequate Sleep, Social Support, and Engaging in Hobbies:  \n",

      "(From data/HealthWellnessGuide.txt)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Embedding Model Choice:**\n",
    "We used OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model, which is a strong general-purpose embedding model. For example, during vibe checking, I have asked about a medical acronym, and the RAG is able to retrieve documents that has information related to the full form of the acronym. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this wellness assistant use case, domain-specific embedding models could potentially improve retrieval quality, but OpenAI's embeddings are robust enough for our scale. This would be worth exploring in a production system with more niche and domain-specific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distance Metric Choice:**\n",
    "We used cosine similarity as our distance metric, which should be standard choice for on embedding models like OpenAI. Also given our application is text-only retrieval so far, cosine similarity works really well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative metrics such as Euclidean and Manhattan also exists, which may work better in some other application/domain scenarios like image embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** No changes made - cosine similarity is already the right choice for OpenAI embeddings."
