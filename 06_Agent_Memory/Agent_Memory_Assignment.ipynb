    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

      "Assistant: Hi Alice! It's wonderful that you're looking to incorporate exercises into your routine. Given your beginner fitness level and your goals of losing weight and reducing stress, here are some tailored exercise recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Walking**: Start with brisk walking for 20-30 minutes a day. It's a simple way to get moving, and you can enjoy the outdoors or listen to music or podcasts while you walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Yoga**: Incorporate beginner-friendly yoga sessions into your week. Look for classes that focus on relaxation and stress relief, such as Hatha or Yin yoga. These can help improve flexibility and promote mindfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Swimming**: If you have access to a pool, swimming is a fantastic low-impact exercise. Aim for 20-30 minutes of swimming a few times a week. It’s great for cardiovascular fitness and can be very refreshing!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Bodyweight Exercises**: As you feel more comfortable, you can add simple bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, and modified push-ups. Start with a few repetitions and gradually increase as you build strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Stretching**: Incorporate stretching into your routine to improve flexibility and help with recovery. You can do this after your walks or yoga sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Mindfulness Activities**: Consider adding activities like meditation or deep breathing exercises to help reduce stress. These can be done alongside your yoga practice or as a standalone activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to listen to your body and progress at your own pace. Consistency is key, and finding activities you enjoy will make it easier to stick with your routine. If you have any questions or need more specific guidance, just let me know!\n",

      "\n",
      "Assistant: Of course, Alice! Let’s dive deeper into walking as an exercise:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Walking: An Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking is one of the simplest and most accessible forms of exercise. It requires no special equipment, can be done almost anywhere, and is suitable for all fitness levels, especially beginners like you.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits of Walking\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Weight Management**: Walking helps burn calories, which can contribute to weight loss when combined with a balanced diet. The number of calories burned depends on your weight, walking speed, and duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Improved Mood**: Walking releases endorphins, which can help reduce stress and anxiety. It’s a great way to clear your mind and boost your mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhanced Cardiovascular Health**: Regular walking strengthens your heart, improves circulation, and can lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Increased Energy Levels**: Walking can help improve your overall energy levels and combat fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Bone and Joint Health**: It’s a low-impact exercise that helps strengthen bones and joints without putting too much stress on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Social Interaction**: Walking can be a social activity. You can invite friends or family to join you, making it a fun way to connect with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips for Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Choose Comfortable Shoes**: Invest in a good pair of walking shoes that provide support and cushioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Start Slow**: If you’re new to walking, begin with shorter distances (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase your time and pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Set Goals**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity walking each week. You can break this down into manageable sessions, like 30 minutes a day, five days a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water before and after your walk, especially if you’re walking for longer periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Mix It Up**: Change your walking routes to keep things interesting. Explore parks, trails, or different neighborhoods.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Listen to Music or Podcasts**: This can make your walks more enjoyable and help pass the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Sample Walking Routine\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Warm-Up**: Start with 5 minutes of slow walking to warm up your muscles.\n",
      "2. **Brisk Walk**: Walk at a pace that feels comfortable but gets your heart rate up for 20-30 minutes.\n",
      "3. **Cool Down**: Finish with 5 minutes of slow walking to cool down and stretch your legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Safety Tips\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Be Aware of Your Surroundings**: If you’re walking outdoors, stay alert to traffic and other pedestrians.\n",
      "- **Walk in Safe Areas**: Choose well-lit and populated areas, especially if you’re walking alone.\n",
      "- **Listen to Your Body**: If you feel any pain or discomfort, take a break or stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking is a fantastic way to start your fitness journey, and it can be easily incorporated into your daily routine. Enjoy your walks, and if you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n",

Given your intermediate fitness level and your preferred activities, here are some exercise recommendations that can help you achieve your goals while being mindful of your lower back pain and knee surgery:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strength-Building Exercises:\n",
      "1. **Weight Training:**\n",
      "   - **Deadlifts (with proper form):** Focus on lighter weights to avoid straining your back. Consider using a trap bar or kettlebell to reduce stress on your lower back.\n",
      "   - **Squats:** Bodyweight squats or goblet squats can be great. Make sure to keep your form in check to protect your knees.\n",
      "   - **Bench Press or Dumbbell Press:** These can help build upper body strength. Use a spotter if you're lifting heavier weights.\n",
      "   - **Seated Rows:** This exercise is excellent for your back and can be done with a cable machine or resistance bands.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cycling:**\n",
      "   - Incorporate cycling into your routine for both strength and cardiovascular benefits. Adjust the seat height to ensure proper knee alignment and reduce strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Flexibility-Improving Exercises:\n",
      "1. **Stretching Routine:**\n",
      "   - **Hamstring Stretch:** Helps with flexibility in your legs and lower back.\n",
      "   - **Hip Flexor Stretch:** Important for flexibility, especially after cycling or weight training.\n",
      "   - **Cat-Cow Stretch:** Great for spinal flexibility and can help alleviate lower back tension.\n",
      "   - **Seated Forward Bend:** This can improve flexibility in your hamstrings and lower back.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Yoga or Pilates:**\n",
      "   - Consider incorporating a gentle yoga or Pilates class into your routine. These practices can enhance flexibility and core strength, which is beneficial for your back and overall stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Tips:\n",
      "- Always warm up before starting your workouts and cool down afterward.\n",
      "- Listen to your body and modify exercises as needed to avoid pain.\n",
      "- If you're unsure about any movements, consider consulting a fitness professional for guidance, especially regarding your back and knee.\n",

      "2. **Seated Forward Bend**: Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Inhale and reach your arms overhead, then exhale as you hinge at your hips to reach toward your toes. This stretch can help relieve tension in your back without putting pressure on your knees.\n",

    "- Semantic memory: use persistent storage for storing facts and knowledge base. This is general knowledge shared across users.\n",
    "- Episodic memory: use persistent storage for storing and retrieving past successful interactions with the user. This can be user specific since different users may have different preferences for successful interactions. We could favor recent episodes vs. older episodes.\n",

      "It's completely understandable to feel worried about experiencing stress again, especially given how it impacted your mood and energy recently. Here are some strategies you can use when you start to feel stressed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Deep Breathing:** Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique. Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7 counts, and exhale for 8 counts. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce feelings of anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This involves tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. It can help release physical tension that often accompanies stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mindfulness or Grounding Techniques:** Take a moment to focus on your surroundings. Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring you back to the present moment and reduce overwhelming feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Short Walks:** Since you enjoy walking, taking a brief walk can help clear your mind and boost your mood. Even a 10-minute walk can make a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Yoga or Stretching:** Incorporating some gentle yoga or stretching can help release tension in your body and promote relaxation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a great way to process stress and gain clarity on what’s bothering you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you’ve had success with the 4-7-8 breathing technique in the past, it might be a good idea to keep that in your toolkit. Would you like to try incorporating any of these strategies into your routine?\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
