    "- Understand and implement multiple retrieval strategies for RAG\n",
    "- Compare naive, BM25, multi-query, parent-document, contextual compression, ensemble, and semantic chunking approaches\n",
    "- Build RAG chains over a health and wellness knowledge base using LangChain and QDrant\n",

    "\n",
    "Using a single user query to retrieve might miss relevant chunks due to the phrasing/wording of the query (e.g., \"workout\" vs \"exercise\"). By contrast, when we generate multiple variations that phrase similar question in different ways, we increase the diversity of the queries that cover different ways of phrasing this similar question semantically. As a result, the union of the chunks that gets retrieved will have a higher chance to cover more ground truth chunks, and this will improve the recall since more relevant chunks get retrieved."

    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sentences are short and highly repetitive, the distance metric in between each sentence is very likely to be very small, and therefore when we use semantic chunking (e.g., when using the default 95-th percentile score to split), it's very likely that a high number of sentences ended up in a big chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ways to adjust the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower the percentile (i.e., the breakpoint threshold) from the default 95-th percentile to something like 80 or even 50-th percentile to creating more chunks. But this may also not lead to very meaningful boundaries between chunks.\n",
    "- Add a max chunk size to force split\n",
    "- Revert to the recursive chunking which may better suit this highly repetitive data"

    "For this wellness dataset, the **naive retriever** actually provides great overall balance of performance, cost, and latency. Performance wise, it has great context recall score (0.95), highest faithfulness score (0.77), high answer relevancy (0.95), and other scores are all decently well. Cost/latency wise, it has a moderate cost and latency. For example, although the cost is higher than bm25, the performance is much better; although ensemble has twice the cost than naive, the marginal performance gain of ensemble is actually minimal on this golden dataset. Same trend for latency as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parent document** is a strong alternative which I may also choose instead of naive retriever. It has the highest context recall score (0.99), and comparable scores to the naive retriever in other metrics except faithfulness and noise sensitivity. The relatively high noise sensitivity (0.14) is because the large parent chunks could contain irrelevant information. Faithfulness is lower also likely because parent document contains more irrelevant information which caused faithfuless score to be lower. But I think these metrics has smaller effect in actual user experience compared to other metrics. On the other hand, parent document has lower cost and latency than naive, which makes it strong alternative to the native method. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for this dataset, I would choose either naive retriever or parent document. But since parent document has lower cost/latency with comparable if not better metrics than naive, I would likely start with parent document approach. We can iterate and change the retrieval strategy based on actual user feedback.\n",

    "**Contextual compression** is a good alternative — it achieves the best factual correctness (0.72) and lowest noise sensitivity (0.05), meaning it retrieves the most precise context. Its cost and latency are also decent, although the cost from Langsmith may not be accurate since we need to do re-rank using Cohere, which might incur additional cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble and multi_query** offer marginal improvements over naive/parent document but at significantly higher cost (1.3-1.8x) and latency (1.5-1.9x), making them poor value tradeoffs. For multi-query, this is likely because we introduce extra LLM calls to create additional queries, while ensemble executes all the retrieval strategies, all of which introduce much higher cost and latency. \n",
    "\n",
    "**BM25** is clearly the weakest for this golden dataset with larger performance gap (e.g., context recall 0.53 vs 0.95+), although it is the cheapest and fastest. BM25 makes more sense if the user query contains more term specific items.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me the key takeaway is that since our source document is a single, well-structured document with clear topical sections, simple naive retrieval works decently well. As our text corpus becomes more complicated like having various different documents across various domains/topics, more advanced strategies like ensemble and multi_query may show greater benefits.\n"
