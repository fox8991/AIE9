## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: complex concept simplification: break down a complicated technical subject into easy-to-understand language
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Information extraction and text summarization by identifying the most important details in a text and summarize them clearly.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative writing and instruction/constratin following, e.g., adhere to word count and settings.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: logical reasoning and math skills
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…

2. Prompt: Help me think through the pros and cons of buying gold now
   - Result: 
        > Certainly\! Buying gold as an investment has both advantages and disadvantages, especially considering its strong price appreciation. Here’s a detailed breakdown to help you think through the decision:
        > ### **Pros of Buying Gold**
        > 
        > 1. Store of Value  
        > * Gold has been a reliable store of value for thousands of years.  
        > * It tends to retain purchasing power over the long term, especially during inflationary periods.  
        > 2. Hedge Against Inflation and Currency Risk  
        > * Gold often appreciates when inflation rises, protecting your wealth.  
        > * It can act as a hedge against currency devaluation and geopolitical instability.  
        > 3. Diversification  
        > * Adding gold to your portfolio diversifies your investments, reducing overall risk.  
        > * It usually has a low or negative correlation with stocks and bonds.  
        > 4. Liquidity  
        > * Gold is highly liquid; you can buy and sell it relatively easily worldwide.  
        > * Physical gold and gold-backed financial products (ETFs, futures) provide various liquidity options.  
        > 5. Strong Price Appreciation  
        > * If gold prices have been appreciating strongly, it suggests momentum and increasing demand.  
        > * Potential for continued capital gains if the underlying factors driving prices remain.  
        > 6. Tangible Asset  
        > * Physical gold is a tangible asset you can hold and store.  
        > * It is not subject to counterparty risk like some financial instruments.
        > 
        > ---
        > 
        > ### **Cons of Buying Gold**
        > 
        > 1. No Yield or Income  
        > * Gold does not generate dividends, interest, or rental income.  
        > * Opportunity cost compared to stocks or bonds that provide cash flow.  
        > 2. Price Volatility  
        > * Despite being a safe haven, gold can experience significant price swings.  
        > * Speculative behavior or changes in macroeconomic conditions can impact prices.  
        > 3. Storage and Security Costs  
        > * Physical gold requires secure storage and insurance, which adds costs.  
        > * Risks of theft or loss if not properly safeguarded.  
        > 4. Market Timing Risk  
        > * Buying after strong price appreciation may mean you are buying at a peak.  
        > * Future returns might be lower or there could be a price correction.  
        > 5. No Growth Component  
        > * Unlike businesses or real estate, gold does not grow or generate earnings.  
        > * Its value depends solely on market demand and perception.  
        > 6. Tax Considerations  
        > * Depending on your country, capital gains taxes on gold can be higher or have specific regulations.  
        > * Selling physical gold might have tax implications different from other investments.
        > 
        > ---
        > 
        > ### **Additional Considerations**
        > 
        > * Investment Horizon: Gold can be a good long-term hedge but may underperform stocks in growth phases.  
        > * Economic Environment: Consider macro factors like interest rates, inflation expectations, and currency trends.  
        > * Allocation Size: Typically, financial advisors suggest 5-10% allocation to gold for diversification.  
        > * Form of Gold Investment: Physical gold vs. ETFs vs. mining stocks vs. futures all have different risk-return profiles.


3. Prompt: What are the pros and cons of AI engineer versus software engineer as the next step in my career?

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: The answers are great in general, however they are not personal enough due to the lack of enough personal context or knowledge cut-off date of the model itself. 

For example: 
- For the first question, assistant does not have any prior knowledge about the person in question, so it can only provide some generic suggestions without personalized results. 
- For the second question about investing in Gold, the response provides general pros/cons of gold investment, but does not provide the most up-to-date information about Gold in Jan 2026 (e.g., it does not mention how much the price is as of now and how much past appreciation Gold had)
- For the third question, again the answers are some general suggestions since I did not provide much info about my past education and work experience for AI assistant to give the most personalized suggestion.

To make a personal assistant, one starting point is to provide relevant useful personal information in the system prompt, so the application can provide more useful answers to personal tasks. 

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: Where is my dinner reservation today?
   - Result: 
        > I don’t have access to your personal calendar or reservations. You might want to check your confirmation email, calendar app, or the restaurant’s website for details about your dinner reservation. If you provide me with more information, I can help you look up similar restaurants or make a new reservation.
2. Prompt: What's the traffic like from my home to school pickup now? 
   - Result: 
        > I don’t have access to real-time data or your location details. You can check current traffic conditions using apps like Google Maps, Waze, or Apple Maps by entering your home and school addresses. If you provide the start and end locations, I can help guide you on how to check or suggest typical traffic patterns for that route.


#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: 
- No access to external tools/applications like email, calendar for searching restaurant reservation infomation
- No access to real-time data through tools like search (e.g., for finding asset prices) or maps (e.g., to search for traffic).
- No personal context (e.g., education background, style preference, dietary preference etc.) to provide personalized results

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1
##### Adjustments Made:
- First change is to make this more useful for personal tasks. The way I achieved this is to provide some personal context information and provided into the system prompt. So it will have more information about my background. This is a naive way to do this, i.e., in-context learning/prompt engineering. More sophisticated extension can be creating tools that can connect to personal info like calendar/email. Or create some personal context storage which the system can retrieve from for answering personal questions. 

- Second main change is to add web search capability to the system so that it has external knowledge beyond the knowledge cut-off date of the model. Latest OpenAI models have the built-in web search capability. However, chat completion model, which we used in first version of the app, can only has access to web search through somewhat older and specialized chat models. The Responses API has access to latest models like GPT5 with web search as one of the available tools. Thus I switched from chat completion model to Responses APIfor this task.  

Overall the changes would make the response to previous personal questions and question that require additional capabilities much more helpful and factual. 

##### Results:
1. Prompt: Help me plan a birthday surprise for Iris; 
    - Result (now it knows who's Iris and what she likes): 
        > Planning a birthday party for Iris sounds like fun! Let's make it special and memorable. Here are some steps and ideas to consider:
        > 
        > Theme Selection: Given Iris's love for dolls and singing, a "Dollhouse & Karaoke" theme might be perfect...
 
2. Prompt: What are the pros and cons of AI engineer versus software engineer given my background?

         > Leverages your technical skills in complex problem-solving.High demand for AI expertise aligns with software skills...
3. Prompt: What's the gold price today and is it a good investment today?
   - Result (it gives real-time information and analysis):
        > Here’s the current gold price and a concise investment outlook:
        > 
        > • As of today, January 16, 2026, gold futures were trading around $4,621.60 per ounce—nearly unchanged from Thursday’s close of $4,623.70 ([finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/gold-price-today-friday-january-16-gold-remains-above-4600-after-an-improved-jobs-report-125316834.html?utm_source=openai)). Spot gold prices are slightly lower, around $4,595.67 per ounce, following a dip of about $16.69 ([pricegold.net](https://pricegold.net/?utm_source=openai)).
        > 
        > • Is it a good time to invest? Many analysts remain bullish for 2026:   – The World Gold Council projects a 15–30% rise this year, driven by falling yields, geopolitical risks, and central bank demand ([livemint.com](https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/gold-price-outlook-5-key-reasons-why-wgc-expects-yellow-metal-prices-to-surge-up-to-30-in-2026/amp-11765176803847.html?utm_source=openai)).   – Major firms like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America forecast gold reaching $5,000+ per ounce by late 2026 ([financemagnates.com](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/gold-price-prediction-2026-wgc-warns-of-20-crash-risk/?utm_source=openai)).   – HSBC suggests a possible surge to $5,000/oz in H1 2026, though it warns of high volatility and a year-end price nearer $4,450 ([ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/gold-2026-trajectory-structural-hedge-facing-volatile-peak-2601/?utm_source=openai)).   – Some caution is warranted: overbought technicals and a historic rally raise the risk of short-term corrections ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-enters-2026-overstretched-after-a-historic-run-raising-drawdown-risk-200672633?utm_source=openai)).
        > 
        > In summary: gold is currently trading near $4,600 per ounce. If you're seeking a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty or financial volatility, and can tolerate possible intra-year swings, it could be a good addition. If you prefer lower-risk or more stable growth, be mindful of potential pullbacks and consider a diversified approach.
        > 
        > Let me know if you'd like help exploring ETFs, timing strategies, or how gold fits your portfolio as a Software Engineer with technical background—gluten‑free cake ideas optional\!
